			<h1>Flocking</h1>
			<h2>By Stephen Fornal</h2>
			<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids algorithm</a>, developed by Craig Reynolds, et al. in 1986, is a simple algorithm for moving objects in space based on a set of rules. The interesting aspect of the algorithm is the emergent behaviors that appear when the rules are applied. It resembles the way birds flock when flying together.</p>
			<p>This demo was created as an exercise. I am attempting to learn a bit more about programming in Javascript, and using the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in particular. I intend to employ an object-oriented design, which I have not previously attempted in Javascript. I will also try my hand at name-spacing in Javascript for the first time.</p>

			<h2>About the Code</h2>
			<p>Since this is mainly an exercise in writing "object-oriented" style Javascript, I started by deciding what classes I would need. I settled on a <code>Vector2</code> class that would represent a vector in 2-dimensional space, a <code>Bird</code> class that would be composed of a <code>Vector2</code> for position and velocity, and a <code>World</code> class that would have a collection of <code>Bird</code> objects and run the animation.</p>
			
			<p>I am using a "name space" object called <code>Boids</code> to act as a container for all of my classes and such. Because I'm working quickly, I have the <code>Bird</code> and <code>World</code> objects tightly coupled. It is probably not the best design ever, but I am more interested in getting it to work than I am in a perfectly designed set of encapsulated objects. The only reason the <code>World</code> is a class at all is that, in theory, you could have multiple canvas elements, each with their own simulation. In reality, the performance will probably suck too much. But I will try it anyway and see what happens!</p>
			
			<h3>Vector2 Class</h3>
			<p>I implemented a simple 2-D vector class (I opted to ignore 3-D for now, since I don't intend to render in 3-D), with basic vector operation like addition, subtraction, dot product, and scale.</p>

			<h3>Bird Class</h3>
			<p>The <code>Bird</code> class encapsulates the movement and rendering rules for the boids. Each boid has a position and velocity, which are <code>Vector2</code> objects, as well as an optional color. Each <code>Bird</code> provides a method that causes it to calculate its new position by updating velocity, then updating position. It also provides a method for rendering itself, currently implemented as an arrow pointing in the direction it's moving.</p>

			<h3>World Class</h3>
			<p>The <code>World</code> class manages all of the birds, and takes care of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> and the animation loop. This was the part that was the hardest to figure out. I originally tried to use <code>setInterval</code> to control the animation, but the performance sucked! After a little research, I came across the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> function, and the polyfill that makes it work cross-browser. That improved the rendering a bit. I also inadvertently improved my understanding of closures in the process.</p>

			<h3>Kicking Things Off</h3>
			<p>To start things up, I create a <code>World</code> object in the <code>window.load</code> event, and fire up its animation loop. Everything seems to load up quickly, and in testing on a variety of devices, I am pleased with the result. <strong>It runs like crap on mobile</strong>, but I guess that's to be expected? It's not an optimized algorithm, and I'm sure I'm doing a fair bit of needless processing. It would probably run faster if I learned how to render to WebGL, at least on iOS devices. There are two demo canvases, one using a default <code>World</code> object, and one using an object that received an option object as a parameter.</p>
