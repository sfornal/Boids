			<h1>Flocking</h1>
			<h2>By Stephen Fornal</h2>
			<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">boids algorithm</a>, developed by Craig Reynolds, et al. in 1986, is a simple algorithm for moving objects in space based on a set of rules. The interesting aspect of the algorithm is the emergent behaviors that appear when the rules are applied. It resembles the way birds flock when flying together.</p>
			<p>This demo was created as an exercise. I am attempting to learn a bit more about programming in Javascript, and using the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in particular. I intend to employ an object-oriented design, which I have not previously attempted in Javascript. I will also try my hand at name-spacing in Javascript for the first time.</p>

			<h2>About the Code</h2>
			<p>Since this is mainly an exercise in writing "object-oriented" style Javascript, I started by
				deciding what classes I would need. I settled on a <code>Vector2</code> class that would represent a vector
				in 2-dimensional space, a <code>Bird</code> class that would be composed of a <code>Vector2</code> for position and velocity, and a <code>World</code> class that would have a collection of <code>Bird</code> objects and run the animation.
			</p>
			
			<p>I am using a "name space" object called <code>Boids</code> to act as a container for all of my classes and such.</p>
			
			<h3>Vector2 Class</h3>
			<p>I implemented a simple 2-D vector class (I opted to ignore 3-D for now, since I don't intend to render in 3-D), with basic vector operation like addition, subtraction, dot product, and scale.</p>
