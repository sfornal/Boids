{"name":"Boids","body":"View the completed project at [http://boids.mrfornal.net](http://boids.mrfornal.net).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is two-fold:\r\n\r\n1. Teach myself JavaScript, using an algorithm I already (mostly) know.\r\n2. Have the results be interesting, and not just a crapy \"Hello, World\"-ish demo.\r\n\r\nHopefully I will learn quite a bit along the way. Thanks for looking!","tagline":"My attempt at recreating Boids using Canvas and JavaScript. This is purely for my own learning.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
