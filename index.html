			<h1>Boids Algorithm Demo</h1>
			<h2>By Stephen Fornal</h2>
			<p>The boids algorithm, developed by Reynolds, et al. in 1985, is a simple algorithm for moving objects in space based on a set of rules. The interesting aspect of the algorithm is the emergent behaviors that appear when the rules are applied. It resembles the way birds flock when flying together.</p>
			<p>This demo was created as an exercise. I am attempting to learn a bit more about programming in JavaScript, and using the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element in particular.</p>
